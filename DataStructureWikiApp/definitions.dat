2D ArrayArrayLinearØA 2D Array, also known as a matrix, is an ordered and static collection of rows and columns containing a single data type that allows duplicates and uses index data retrieval.ArrayArrayLinearxAn Array is an ordered and static collection of a single data type that allows duplicates and uses index data retrieval.Binary Search TreeTree
Non-Linear∑A Binary Search Tree consists of nodes where the left child node must be less than or equal to the parent node, and the right child node must be more than or equal to the parent node.GraphGraphs
Non-LinearßA Graph is a collection of nodes connected by lines. Graphs can be directed where lines show the path from one node to another, or undirected where lines are pathless.
Hash TableHash
Non-Linear‚A Hash Table is an unordered static or dynamic collection of various data types that allows duplicates and uses a hash function to assign data a unique index to form a key-value pair for data insertion, retrieval and deletion.HeapTree
Non-Linear¡A Heap organises nodes in a tree using min heap where the parent node is less than or equal to either child nodes, or max heap where the parent node is more than or equal to either child nodes.Linked ListListLinearŒA Linked List is a dynamic collection of nodes that allows duplicates and uses index retrieval. A node contains two fields, one for the data and one for the location of the next node to link nodes together.ListListLinearíA List, also known as a sequence, is an ordered and dynamic collection of various data types that allows duplicates and uses index data retrieval.QueueAbstractLinearùA Queue is an ordered and dynamic collection of various data types that allows duplicates and uses First In First Out data insertion, retrieval and deletion.Self-Balance TreeTree
Non-LinearèA Self-Balanced Tree is designed to maintain minimum tree height after insertion and deletion operations by performing left or right rotations.SetAbstract
Non-LinearÄA Set is an ordered or unordered dynamic collection of various data types that must be unique and uses iteration data retrieval.StackAbsractLinear∑A Stack is an ordered static or dynamic collection of various data types that allows duplicates and uses Last In First Out or First In Last Out data insertion, retrieval and deletion.
